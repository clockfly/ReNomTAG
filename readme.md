## Build Javascript (for developers)

## Create working directory for the ReNomTAG app
A working directory is needed to run the ReNomTAG app.
Note that the directory structure is fixed. Please confirm the details at the following page.
http://renom.jp/packages/renomtag/ja/rsts/how_to_use.html#before-starting

For instance:
 ```
 working_directory # Current Working directory
     │  
     └── public # This folder must be named `public`.
         │  
         └── user1 # Dataset for user1. You can use any name for this directory.
             ├── dataset # Directory containing images for tagging. The folder name must be set to `dataset`.
             │   ├── image1.jpg
             │   ├── image2.jpg
             │   ├── ...
             │   └── imageN.jpg
             └── label # Directory to which tag data will output. The folder name must be set to `label`.
                 ├── image1.xml
                 ├── image2.xml
                 ├── ...
                 └── imageN.xml
 ```

The directories above can be made using the following commands:
 ```
mkdir ~/working_directory
cd ~/working_directory
mkdir public
mkdir public/user1
mkdir public/user1/label
mkdir public/user1/dataset
 ```


## How to run the app

Once installed, you can run ReNomTAG as follows.

```
$ python -m renom_tag
```

You can also use the `renom_tag` command installed by wheel.

```
$ renom_tag
```
Use your web browser to access the address and port listed in the console.


## Debugging (for developers)
You can also use webpack-dev-server for debugging.
Before starting the dev-server with the following commands,
make sure that the ReNomTAG app is running in the working_directory (see ## How to run the app).

For the first time:
```
$ cd js
$ npm run start
```
From the second time onward:
```
$ cd js
$ npm run dev
```

## Try the app

If you want to try the app but don't have a particular dataset to use, the following dataset is available. Please download it and place the photos in the "public/'user'/dataset" folder.
